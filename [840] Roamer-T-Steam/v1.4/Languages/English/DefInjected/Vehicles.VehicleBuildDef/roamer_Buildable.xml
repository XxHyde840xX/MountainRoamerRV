Featuring loads of room for passengers and cargo, this rugged and powerful 6x6 will get you out of the fray in a hurry. And if all's well on the homefront? Use it for long-distance business and trade, or find somewhere scenic to take a nice camping trip. \n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Passenger x5\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</roamer_Blueprint.description>
