	<description>Chinese to English translation of @RedFox_2020 and @qwqwqwq's "Mountain Roamer" Caravan / RV. I apologize for any mistranslations as I do not speak Chinese. 
	Big thanks to the original authors for allowing me to do a translation for their awesome mod. I hope you guys enjoy their mod as much as I have.
	
	As a bonus, I noticed the hood-shading for the east/west view wasn't quite right, so I took the liberty of giving it a quick touch up. Hope you guys don't mind.
	
	If the original authors wish at any time for me to remove this from the workshop, I will comply with their request to do so.
